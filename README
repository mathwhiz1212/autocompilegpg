Script that automatically downloads, verifies and compiles GnuPG. 

This script downloads, verifies, compiles and installs GnuPG-1.4.19 or upgrades current version to GnuPG-1.4.19.

The goal of this script is to upgrade all of the GnuPG V.1.* to V.1.4.19 as there are many vulnerable versions floating around, even the last version is vulnerable.

Currently this script requires: A debian based linux distro, A working internet connection, wget, apt, tar, bash 3.0+ and gpg or sha1sum. Most debian based linux distros meet all of these.

Installation using sha1sum is the fastest and most user friendly. 

Please check the sha checksum with sha1sum e.g. sha1sum -c GnuPG1.4.19.sh.sha

This script has been tested to work on Trisquel, linux mint and ubuntu. For operating systems that do not have sudo installed please use the nosudo version of the script, you need to run the nosudo script as root for it to run successfully.

In enviroments with unreliable or nonexistant internet please use the offline script found here: https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/autocompilegpg-offline
