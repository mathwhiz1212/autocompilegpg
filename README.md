# simpleautocompilegpg
Simple script that automatically downloads, verifies and compiles GnuPG. 

This scirpt installs GnuPG-1.4.19 or upgrades current version to GnuPG-1.4.19.

The goal of this script is to upgrade all of the GnuPG V.1.* to V.1.4.19 as there are many vulnerable versions floating around, even the last version is vulnerable.

Currently this script requires: A debian based linux distro. A working internet connection, firefox and gpg or sha1sum.

This script has been tested to work on Linux mint.
