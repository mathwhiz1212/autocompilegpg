# simpleautocompilegpg
Simple script that automatically downloads, verifies and compiles gnupg. 

The current version installs/upgrades gpg to gpg V.1.4.19.

Currently this script requires: A debian based linux distro. A working internet connection, firefox and gpg or sha1sum.

This script should work on most debian based distros, with a little modification someone else could make it work on others.

This script has been tested to work on Linux mint.

Feel free to offer suggestions.
